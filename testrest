# OBA API - Use this API to translate named stops (say, presented to
# the user via some list) to a stop ID, which the stop-monitoring API
# will then use. May be a good idea for app to precompile this
# information for a given user, once they've selected a stop to
# track. If the user deletes the stop, then after a certain amount of
# time, this saved info could get pruned from the database.
